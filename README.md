# Python_Leranings
Repository of all learning exercise 

Hello me,

I was atcually running a python tutorial online, and was covering the topic list.
Had though of a basic problem of printing a list with a pattern.

Input would be a list :
   ls_or = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
Output should be :
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]\n
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
  [1, 2, 3, 4]
  [1, 2, 3]
  [1, 2]
  [1]
I know it is really simple but for a starter like its amazing :) cheers all and to me

Happy Learnings
